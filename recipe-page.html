    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 large eggs (separated)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>¼ cup (30g) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil or butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Whisk the egg yolks, milk, and vanilla extract until combined. Sift
            in the
            flour and baking powder, then mix until smooth.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites with a hand mixer until foamy. Gradually add sugar, continuing to
            beat until stiff peaks form.
        </li>
        <li>
            Gently fold the meringue into the egg yolk mixture in three additions using a spatula.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat a non-stick pan over low heat and lightly grease it with oil or butter. Spoon the batter into tall,
            round mounds.
            Add 1 tablespoon of water to the pan and cover with a lid to create steam. Cook for about 4 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Carefully flip the pancakes using a spatula. Cover and cook for another 3–4 minutes until golden and fully
            set.
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer the pancakes to a plate and dust with powdered sugar.
        </li>
    </ol>
